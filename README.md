# FullStackDevAssessment

## Instructions
0. Make sure Docker is installed
1. Clone or download repo
2. Navigate to directory in terminal
3. Run 'docker-compose up'

## Notes
### Challenges
- Never used TypeScript
- Never used Node.js
- Never used PostgreSQL
- Never used React
- Haven't used Docker a lot
- Remade the repository halfway through to try and understand how to develop the backend and restructure the project (you can view the old repo here: https://github.com/jrdike/FullStackDevAssessment)
- Took a while to understand how to use Postgres from a Docker container
- Needed more time to understand React hooks and API calls

### Comforts
- TypeScript is very similar to JavaScript and I was able to pick it up quickly
- Implementing the initial frontend logic was cool

### Clarifications
- Overall pretty clear
